# Evertz 9000RF-Probe

The Evertz 9000RF-Probe is a real-time radio frequency (RF) and transport stream (TS) monitoring system that is able to monitor multiple RF sources simultaneously. Each RF probe is a 1RU rack-based unit and can have 8x, 16x, or 32x RF inputs. The RF probe is able to tune and demodulate satellite DVBS/S2/S2x, ATSC, DVBT/T2, ISDBT, QAM, and DVBC/C2 signals.

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination (default: *161*).
- **Bus address**: The bus address of the device.

SNMP Settings:

- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device (default: *public*).
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device (default: *private*).

## How to use

This connector communicates with the 9000RF-Probe device via SNMP, and it can export DVEs for each of the RF Inputs.

The following data pages are available in the main element:

- **General**: Displays general system info for the device, including its type and features.

- **Data Ports**: Contains the Data Port, SFP, and IP tables, which are related to the communication settings of the device. We recommend updating this info from the device's web interface.

- **RF Inputs**: Contains the details of the RF Probe Inputs and Channels. In the *RF Configuration* Table, the *Device DVE* setting allows generation of DVEs based on the RF Input.

- **Channel Polling Manager**: This page allows the enabling or disabling of polling for certain channels. This can be used to disable polling for channels that are not in use.
